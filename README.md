# Federated Multimodal LLM in Clinical AI

This project implements a federated learning system using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for clinical decision support. It focuses on preserving patient privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed healthcare environments.

## Key Components
- Flower framework for federated orchestration
- ClinicalBERT fine-tuned on MedNLI (natural language inference)
- Simulated clients to mimic hospital data silos

## Project Structure
- `code/`: Federated learning training scripts and model code
- `error_logs/`: Screenshots and logs of errors encountered
- `daily_summary/`: Text summaries of daily activities
- `outputs/`: Model checkpoints and evaluation metrics
- `visuals/`: System architecture diagrams, Gantt chart, etc.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the `code/` directory to run the training locally.
