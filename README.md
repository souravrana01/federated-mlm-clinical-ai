# Federated MLLM for Clinical Decision Support

This project implements a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) pipeline for training **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** on distributed clinical datasets using the **Flower framework**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, and **PyTorch**.

## 🧠 Project Summary

The project aims to answer the question:

> _“How can federated MLLM training strategies be designed and evaluated to effectively leverage distributed medical data for scalable improvements in AI-driven clinical decision support, while maintaining robust patient privacy across diverse healthcare environments?”_

Using the **MedNLI** dataset and the **ClinicalBERT** model, we simulate client-server interactions using Flower and evaluate the feasibility of decentralized training of clinical MLLMs under privacy constraints.
