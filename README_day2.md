# Day 2: MedNLI Data Loading for Federated MLLM

This script loads the `mednli_train.jsonl` dataset locally and tokenizes it using Bio_ClinicalBERT.

## Instructions

1. Download `mednli_train.jsonl` manually from a trusted source.
2. Place it in the same directory as this script.
3. Run the script to verify dataset is loading correctly and tokenization works.

## Output

The script prints one tokenized batch from the dataset.
